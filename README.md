# Project2_Applied Data Science
### Goals:
This project is to build a **CNNs** pipeline to classify cells perturbation in the micro-images, following steps below:
1. Data Loading and Create train and test datasets with their corresponding labels.
2. Segment cells from near 2000 micro-images
3. Extract features from these segmented cell-images
4. Build CNNs to classify perturbed or not

### Result
All ideas, pipeline and results are shown in the report.
